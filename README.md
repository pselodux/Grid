# Teensy Grid

### Description
8x8 grid controller using Teensy and Arduinome PCB. Currently unfinished! I'm still working on getting the LEDs to light properly before moving on to other things. If you see this code and have a better idea about how to implement varying brightness levels on an 8x8 LED matrix, let me know.

### Features to come
* Incoming MIDI notes light each pad depending on velocity, with note offs turning them off.
* MIDI output for each pad

### Nice to have features to come
* Possible built-in sequencer mode, for Norns/computer-free operation
* 3.5mm MIDI out, so a USB host isn't required
